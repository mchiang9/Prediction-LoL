## Abstract
League of Legends is the most played video game in the world with about 27 million players daily. The game involves working with teammates to destroy the enemy base through a series of earning gold, destroying towers and slaying the enemy champions. In the most popular game mode, there are 5 teammates that typically fulfill 5 roles: Top, Jungle, Mid, Marksman, and Support. The roles that must work together the most are the Marksman and Support roles. We are going to build a program that classifies the best support champion based on the marksman chosen, what team side you are on and enemy team champions chosed.
